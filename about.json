    "bio": "In 2022, I graduated from the University of Massachusetts Boston 
    with a degree in Accounting, Information Systems, and Business Analytics. 
    My college career involved multiple part-time and internship positions at Ernst and Young, 
    where I eventually began working full-time as a Technology Risk Consultant in the same year. 
    While at EY, I conducted IT audits for clients across various industries, 
    including Manufacturing, Aerospace Science, Health Care, and Bio-Tech. 
    Additionally, I coached EY teams on reading complex program scripts in languages such as 
    Python, SQL, and HTML to identify risks. 
    These experiences led me to develop a passion for software engineering, 
    and I am currently enrolled in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Program, 
    with a graduation date set for June 2023. 
    In my free time, I enjoy teaching and taking Taekwondo classes"
